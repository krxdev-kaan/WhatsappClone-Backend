## Description
This is the backend for the term project for CS310 course. It will be the backend of a Whatsapp Clone Application.

## Tech Stack (Backend)
- ### Java
- ### Spring Boot
- ### MongoDB

## Building
1. Open the project in your favorite IDE, after making IntelliJ IDEA your favorite IDE ofc.
2. Let Gradle setup the tasks and IDE configurations.
3. If step 2 did not start automatically, run your terminal and call "gradlew" by hand.
4. Run the backend.

## Code Formatting / Styling
#### There are 3 simple styling rules I would like to be followed:
1. Any curly bracket produced by a function declaration, class declaration or if/for/while statement should be on their separate line.
2. No leading or trailing new line inside class declarations. This might've been good ONLY IF the first rule wasn't there.
3. No unnecessarily weird variable names, hardcoded values/messages etc. (This last would be a pain if we were to be making any multi-language response system so it should be followed for good practice.)
